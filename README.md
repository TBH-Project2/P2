# __Executive Voices__

## Comparing the Performance of the LSTM and VADER Deep Learning models when performing NLP. for sentiment Analysis. 

### Project Purpose:

To demonstrate two different methods that are used to perform sentiment analysis, and compare their efficacy  when applied to comments  made by executives during an earnings call.

### Project Overview:
Executive Voices is a tool that allows you to do run a sentiment anlyisis on a typed statement of any kind and determine the overall sentiment score of the processed text. The project can be used to compare the results of LSTM and VADER when used in Natural Language Processing using various metrics and testing techniques. We used management's comments in the Intel Corp 2020 Q4 earnings call analyzed the overall tone of the CEO.

### Built With:
This project is written in Python using Jupyter Notebook in combination with tha following modules.
* [JupyterNotebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [scikitLearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

    
## Using the Tool:
This project is written in Python on Jupyter Notebook. To setup an instance of this project on your own, you need to install Jupyter Notebook [JupyterNotebook](https://jupyter.org/), as well as the following Python modules.To use Executive Voices, follow these steps in GitBash or your terminal:

pip install Pandas
pip install -U scikit-learn  
pip install -U  nltk   
pip install --user -U nltk
