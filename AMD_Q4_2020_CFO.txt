Devinder Kumar -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer

Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2020 was an outstanding year for AMD. Our industry-leading product portfolio and market share gains drove record annual and quarterly revenue with full-year revenue growth of 45%. We also achieved record annual net income and free cash flow.

We are pleased with our strong performance and the leverage in our financial model. Fourth-quarter revenue was $3.24 billion, up 53% from a year ago and up 16% from the prior quarter, driven by strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC process and semi-custom game console SoCs. Gross margin was 45%, approximately flat year over year. Operating expenses was $789 million, up 45% year over year, driven by increased investments in R&D, go-to-market activities, and higher variable employee compensation-related expenses.

Operating income was $663 million, up $258 million or 64% from a year ago, driven by significant revenue growth. And operating margin was 20%, compared to 19% a year ago. Net income was $636 million, up $253 million or 66% from a year ago. And diluted earnings per share was $0.52, compared to $0.32 per share a year ago.

Now, turning to the business segment results. Fourth-quarter computing and graphics segment revenue was $1.96 billion, up 18% year over year, primarily driven by a significant Ryzen processor growth. Computing and graphics segment operating income was $420 million, or 21% of revenue, compared to 360-- $360 million a year ago, driven by higher revenue. Enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment revenue was $1.28 billion, up 176% year over year, driven by strong semi-custom product sales and continued EPYC server processor momentum across the cloud and enterprise markets.

EPYC processor revenue grew sequentially, including early shipments of third-generation EPYC Milan processors. EESC segment operating income was $243 million, or 19% of revenue, compared to an operating income of $45 million a year ago, driven by higher revenue. Turning to the balance sheet. We had record free cash flow of $480 million in the fourth quarter.

Inventory was $1.4 billion, up 8% from the prior quarter, in preparation of 2021 sales. Fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA was $753 million, compared to $469 million a year ago, driven by higher quarterly earnings. Before I turn to the full-year financial results, let me address a GAAP tax item. Based on our financial results and strong outlook, we released a significant portion of our tax valuation allowance, totaling $1.3 billion, which had a GAAP EPS benefit of $1.06 in the fourth quarter and a benefit of $1.07 for the full year.

Now, let me turn to our full-year financial results. 2020 revenue was $9.76 billion, up 45% year on year, driven by strong growth in both business segments. Gross margin of 45% was up 190 basis points from the prior year, driven by Ryzen and EPYC products, partially offset by semi-custom and Radeon product sales. Operating expenses were 28% of revenue, improving from 31% in 2019.

2020 operating income was up 97% from a year ago to $1.66 billion or 17% of revenue. Net income was $1.58 billion, up 108% from the prior year. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $2.3 billion at year-end, and full-year free cash flow was $777 million, as compared to $276 million in 2019.

We reduced principal debt by $225 million in 2020 and ended the year with $338 million of gross debt. Now, turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2021. We expect revenue to be approximately $3.2 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 79% year over year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by growth in all businesses.

The sequential performance is driven primarily by better than normal seasonality in our PC and semi-custom businesses and strength in our data center business. In addition, for Q1 2021, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $830 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes, and other to be approximately $105 million, including an effective tax rate of 15%, and first-quarter diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.23 billion shares. For the full-year 2021, we expect revenue growth of approximately 37%, driven by growth in all businesses. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 26% of revenue, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 15%, and we expect that company's cash tax rate to be approximately 3%.

In closing, I am very pleased with our 2020 results which demonstrate the strength of AMD's product momentum, customer traction, and market share gains. As we enter 2021 and continue to invest in the business and execute our long-term strategy, we are well-positioned to drive gross margin expansion, increase profitability, and deliver strong shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for the question-and-answer session. Ruth.
