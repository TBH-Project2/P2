# __Executive Voices__

## Comparing the Performance of the LSTM and VADER Deep Learning models when performing NLP. for sentiment Analysis. 

### Project Purpose:
_Demonstrate the use of an NLP model on executive statements to interpret the tone and sentiments. 10-k's, 10-q's, earning calls, and other financial statements are often read by investors to foress price changes in the company's stock._

### Project Overview:
1. First, define a database model based on the .csv file data in the CSV_Data folder and create a database diagram normalizing the data in the best possible structure:__
  1. Create a PostgreSQL database from the model.
1. Add any necessary schema's and import the .csv data into the tables.
1. Analyze the data looking for possible fraudulent transactional trends.

Executive Voices is a tool that allows you to do run a sentiment anlyisis on a typed statement of any kind and determine thethe overall sentiment score of the processed text. The project can be used to compare the results of LSTM and VADER when used in Natural Language Processing using various metrics and testing techniques.

zin the text we used, we decided to use the ....... from Intel Corp. on ..... and anlyze the overalltone of the CEO and the CFO.
